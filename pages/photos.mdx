## Concepts
Here is a compilation of concepts learnt so far!

## Binary Search 
### Basics 

* Binary Search is an optimised search algorithm. 
* It is only valid in **sorted** algorithms. 
* The time complexity is: **O(logn)**

### How it works, 
* First we have two pointers, left and right. 
* Left points towards the beginning of the array and right points to the end. 
* We calculate the median of the array.

* IF: the target is less than the middle element, we search the left half.
* ELSE: we search the right half. 
Repeat this until we've found the element!

## Trees

#### Basics

* Trees is a **non-linear data structure**
* Binary Tree: A tree where every node has **atmost 2 children** 
* Types of Binary Trees 
** Full Binary Tree: It either has 2 children, or no children.
** Complete Binary Tree/Binary Heaps:  The tree is uniformly filled (can be missed out on places, but they are uniformly filled).
** Perfect Binary Tree: All the parents in this tree have exactly 2 children nodes. All leaves are on the same level!

``` Perfect Binary Tree = Full + Complete ```

#### Traversals in tree
* **Pre**Order : Node, Left, Right

* **In**Order: Left, Node, Right

* **Post**Order: Left, Right, Node

### Traversals 
* Depth First Search: This search starts from a node till its leaf (Uses Recursion/Stack)
* Breadth First Search: This search analyses all the nodes on a level (Uses a Queue)
